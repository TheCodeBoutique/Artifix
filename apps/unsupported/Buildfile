# This is your Buildfile for your app, Teacher. This tells SproutCore
# how to build your app. These settings override those in your project
# Buildfile, which contains default settings for all apps in your project.

# This line tells SproutCore's CSS preprocessor what class names to target.
# Since your app has a theme named 'teacher', and it is based on SproutCore's
# Ace theme (named 'ace'), it is set to 'ace.teacher'.
